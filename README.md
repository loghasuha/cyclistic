# **Cyclistic Case Study** 
This case study is about a company Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, I analyse the scenario and produce a report on how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
